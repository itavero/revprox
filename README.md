# :arrow_right_hook: revprox
Set of scripts to allow for an easy set-up of a reverse proxy with SSL support,
so you can access all your hobby projects running at home without having to
remember all those port numbers.

Based on / uses:
* [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)
* [Sewer](https://github.com/komuw/sewer)
* [YAML](http://yaml.org/)

_Do note that this list may likely change while development is still in progress._

## :warning: Current state
Nothing here yet. :wink:

I'm still working on an initial version, which will focus on preparing and
maintaining a FreeNAS Jail as a Reverse Proxy.
